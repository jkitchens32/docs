title: "Updating a Linux installation"

If you have an existing Replication Server installed on Linux, you can use yum to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

`yum upgrade edb-repo`

`yum` will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade any installed packages:

`yum upgrade ppas-xdb*`

See [Upgrading from a Replication Server RPM Package Installation](../10_appendix/02_upgrading_to_xdb6_2/03_upgrading_with_xdb_rpm_package/) for details.
