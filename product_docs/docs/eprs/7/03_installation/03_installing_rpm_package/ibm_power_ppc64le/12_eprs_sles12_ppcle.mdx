There are two steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```shell
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Set up the Repository

Setting up the repository is a one time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform these steps.

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository 
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration 
# information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE modules
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/ppc64le
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/ppc64le

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh

# Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) 
zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
```

## Install the Package

You can install all Replication Server components with a single install command, or you may choose to install selected, individual components by installing only those particular packages.

To install all Replication Server components:

```shell
zypper install edb-xdb
```

To install an individual component:

```shell
zypper install package_name
```

Where `package_name` is:

| Package name         | Component                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edb-xdb-console`    | EPRS Replication Console and the Replication Server Command Line Interface |
| `edb-xdb-publisher`  | Publication server                                                         |
| `edb-xdb-subscriber` | Subscription server                                                        |
