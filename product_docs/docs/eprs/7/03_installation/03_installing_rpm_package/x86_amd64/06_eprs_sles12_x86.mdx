You can use the `zypper` package manager to install the Replication Server on an SLES 12 host. `zypper` will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).


## Set up the repository

1. Use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

    ```shell
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas96-sles.repo
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-tools.repo
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-dependencies.repo
    ```

    Each command creates a repository configuration file in the /etc/zypp/repos.d directory. The files are named:

    - `edbas96suse.repo`
    - `edbasdependencies.repo`
    - `edbastools.repo`


2. Use the `zypper refresh command` to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repositories, as shown below. When prompted for a user name and password, provide your connection credentials for the EnterpriseDB repository.

    ```shell
    /etc/zypp/repos.d # zypper refresh
    Repository 'SLES12-12-0' is up to date.
    Repository 'SLES12-Pool' is up to date.
    Repository 'SLES12-Updates' is up to date.

    Authentication required for 'https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/10/suse/suse-12-x86_64'
    User Name:

    All repositories have been refreshed.
    ...
    ```

1. Add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

    ```shell
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64
    ```

    For detailed information about registering a SUSE host, visit:

    > <https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626>

1. Add the Java repository and update the repository metadata. Only OpenJDK 1.8 is supported on SLES hosts of Java components. Before using an RPM installer to add Advanced Server or a supporting component that requires Java, use `zypper` to add supporting repository locations to your system. Enter the following commands:

    ```shell
    zypper addrepo "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Java:/Factory/SLE_12_SP2/Java:Factory.repo"
    zypper addrepo "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/Kolab:/3.3/SLE_12/server:Kolab:3.3.repo"
    zypper refresh
    ```

## Install the package

Use the zypper utility to install the Replication Server components:

```shell
zypper install edb-xdb*
```

## Initial configuration

Before starting the publication server and subscription server, the `/etc/hosts` file must contain an entry for the host name that associates it to the host IP address as shown by the following example where `192.168.187.133` is the IP address and `linux-dm8s` is the host name:

```shell
192.168.187.133              linux-dm8s
```
