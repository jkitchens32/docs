You can use it to inspect and manage cluster resources and to get information on the following:

-   node summary
-   BDR/Postgres version on each node
-   replication and subscription details
-   membership and worker events
-   raft consensus details
-   CAMO (Commit at Most Once) details
-   clock skew
-   cluster health summary

## Supported version

The PGD CLI supports BDR 4.1 and later.
