title: 'Known issues'

This section discusses currently known issues in EDB Postgres Distributed 4.

## Data Consistency

Please remember to read about [Conflicts](/bdr/latest/conflicts/) to understand
the implications of the asynchronous operation mode in terms of data
consistency.

## List of Issues

In this section we list a number of known issues that are tracked in BDR's
ticketing system, that are expected to be re-solved in one of the future
releases.

-   Performance of HARP in terms of failover and switchover time depends
    non-linearly on the latencies between DCS nodes. Which is why
    we currently recommend using etcd cluster per region for HARP in case
    of EDB Postgres Distributed deployment over multiple regions (typically
    the Gold and Platinum layouts). TPAexec already sets up the etcd do run
    per region cluster for these when `harp_consensus_protocol` option
    is set to `etcd` in the `config.yml`.

    It's recommended to increase the `leader_lease_duration` HARP option
    (`harp_leader_lease_duration` in TPAexec) for DCS deployments across higher
    latency network.

-   If the resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict
    is set to `skip`, and `synchronous_commit=remote_apply` is used, and
    concurrent updates of the same row are repeatedly applied on two
    different nodes, then one of the update statements might hang due
    to a deadlock with the BDR writer.  As mentioned in the
    [Conflicts](/bdr/latest/conflicts/) chapter, `skip` is not the default
    resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict, and this
    combination is not intended to be used in production: it discards
    one of the two conflicting updates based on the order of arrival
    on that node, which is likely to cause a divergent cluster.
    In the rare situation that you do choose to use the `skip`
    conflict resolver, please note the issue with the use of the
    `remote_apply` mode.

-   Decoding Worker feature does not work with CAMO/EAGER/Group Commit.
    Installations using CAMO/Eager/Group Commit must keep `enable_wal_decoder`
    disabled.

-   Decoding Worker works only with the default replication sets

-   Lag Control does not adjust commit delay in any way on a fully
    isolated node, i.e. in case all other nodes are unreachable or not
    operational. As soon as at least one node is connected, Replication
    Lag Control will pick up its work and adjust the BDR commit delay,
    again.

-   For time based Lag Control, BDR currently uses the lag time (measured
    by commit timestamps) rather than the estimated catchup time that is
    based on historic apply rate.

-   Changing the CAMO partners in a CAMO pair is not currently possible.
    It's only possible to add or remove a pair.
    Adding or removing a pair does not need a restart of Postgres or even a
    reload of the configuration.

-   Group Commit cannot be combined with [CAMO](/bdr/latest/camo/) or [Eager All Node
    replication](/bdr/latest/eager/). Eager Replication currently only works by using the
    "global" BDR commit scope.

-   Neither Eager replication nor Group Commit support
   `synchronous_replication_availability = 'async'`.

-   Group Commit does not support support for a timeout of the
    commit after `bdr.global_commit_timeout`.

-   Transactions using Eager Replication cannot yet execute DDL,
    nor do they support explicit two-phase commit.
    Note that the TRUNCATE command is allowed.

-   Not all DDL can be run when either CAMO or Group Commit is used.

-   Parallel apply is not currently supported in combination with Group
    Commit, please make sure to disable it when using Group Commit by
    either setting `num_writers` to 1 for the node group (using
    [`bdr.alter_node_group_config`](/bdr/latest/nodes#bdralter_node_group_config)) or
    via the GUC `bdr.writers_per_subscription` (see
    [Configuration of Generic Replication](/bdr/latest/configuration#generic-replication)).

-   There currently is no protection against altering or removing a commit
    scope. Running transactions in a commit scope that is concurrently
    being altered or removed may lead to the transaction blocking or
    replication stalling completely due to an error on the downstream node
    attempting to apply the transaction. Please ensure that any transactions
    using a specific commit scope have finished before altering or removing it.

## List of Limitations

This section contains a (non-comprehensive) list of design limitations that are
expected and are by design, and hence are not expected to be resolved in the
future.

-   Replacing a node with it's physical standby does not work for nodes that
    use CAMO/Eager/Group Commit. Combining physical standbys and BDR is in
    general not recommended, even if otherwise possible.

-   A `galloc` sequence might skip some chunks if the
    sequence is created in a rolled back transaction and then created
    again with the same name, or if it is created and dropped when DDL
    replication is not active and then it is created again when DDL
    replication is active.
    The impact of the problem is mild, because the sequence
    guarantees are not violated; the sequence will only skip some
    initial chunks. Also, as a workaround the user can specify the
    starting value for the sequence as an argument to the
    `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()` function.

-   Legacy BDR synchronous replication uses a mechanism for transaction
    confirmation different from the one used by CAMO, Eager and Group Commit .
    The two are not compatible and must not be used together. Therefore, nodes
    that appear in `synchronous_standby_names` must not be part of CAMO, Eager
    or Group Commit configuration. Using synchronous replication to other nodes,
    including both logical and physical standby is possible.
