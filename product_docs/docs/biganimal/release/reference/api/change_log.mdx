title: BigAnimal API v2 change log
---

## Notification

BigAnimal API follows the OpenAPI Specification (or formerly known as Swagger Specification). All API endpoints are relative to the base URL. For more information, see [API Server and Base URL](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/).

```
https://api.example.com/v1/users?role=admin&status=active

         server URL       endpoint    query parameters
                            path
```

The summary of the API changes between v1 and v2 are:

| Type          | Description                                      | Effect count |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Server URL    | Server URL (/api/v1/ to /api/v2/)                | 30           |
| Endpoint path | Endpoint path                                    | 21           |
| Method        | GET/POST/DELETE/PUT/PATCH                        | 5            |
| Added         | new endpoints                                    | 9            |

All REST APIs's server URLs are changed from /api/v1 to /api/v2, so in the following part, we won't point out them seperately.
